/**
 * `GET`/`POST /api/v1/media/enforcement` (ADR-0026 step 5a) — the managed-media
 * enforcement switch a brochure-site operator previously did not have.
 *
 * Steps 3-4 made media independent of `news_portal`, but left the flag
 * (`sql/078`) writable only by `news_portal`'s R2-only preset. A tenant running
 * `blog_content` + `tenant_domain` therefore had the capability and no way to
 * turn it on. This route is that way.
 *
 * ## POST is enable-only, and there is deliberately no DELETE/disable
 *
 * See `enable-managed-media-enforcement.ts`'s header for the full reasoning.
 * Short version: a tenant able to switch its own media validation OFF is the
 * exact exploit `sql/043` documents as confirmed-exploitable in review, so the
 * "off" transition does not exist anywhere in this codebase. Do not add it here.
 *
 * ## Why GET exposes readiness `reasons`
 *
 * So an operator who cannot enable can see WHY (R2 disabled, config incomplete,
 * credentials shared with sync-storage) instead of being told "no". The reasons
 * are deployment-config facts the tenant's own admin already has to act on with
 * their operator; they name variables, never values, so nothing secret leaks.
 * `GET` is still permission-gated (`enforcement.read`) rather than public.
 *
 * No `Idempotency-Key` is required: enabling is a naturally idempotent upsert of
 * one boolean-shaped marker with no external side effect and no resource
 * created, so a replayed request converges on the same state rather than
 * duplicating anything. This matches `POST .../upload-sessions`, which likewise
 * requires none.
