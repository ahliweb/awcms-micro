/**
 * `comments` — Official Optional Module admitted by ADR-0032 (Issue #271, epic
 * #261 Wave 2). Admission + first runtime code land together in this PR, bumping
 * the base registry 20 → 21 (`EXPECTED_BASE_MODULE_COUNT` in
 * scripts/scope-consistency-check.ts, regenerated inventories).
 *
 * ## What this module OWNS
 *
 * A tenant-scoped, MODERATION-FIRST commenting system over PUBLISHED, PUBLIC
 * commentable resources — threads (`awcms_micro_comments_threads`), comments
 * (`awcms_micro_comments_comments`, sql/089, RLS FORCE'd, bounded reply depth,
 * privacy-minimized author fields), append-only moderation history + abuse
 * reports, per-tenant settings, minimized anti-abuse telemetry, and minimized,
 * encrypted reply-notify subscriptions. It serves the PUBLIC submit/list/reply/
 * edit/report/delete-request API and the ABAC-guarded, audited admin moderation
 * API under `/api/v1/comments/*`.
 *
 * ## Direction of the arrow (ADR-0032 §2) — depends on nothing but Core
 *
 * `comments` is the CONSUMER/aggregator: content modules PROVIDE reviewed,
 * pure-data `CommentableResourceDescriptor`s via
 * `ModuleDescriptor.commentableResources` (declarative table/column mapping +
 * publication filter — never an executable extractor), which this module's
 * generic engine reads through `listModules()`. It does NOT declare a
 * `commentable_resource` capability `provides` (that would trip
 * `capability_provider_conflict`) — the descriptor-list riding `listModules()` is
 * the multi-provider, derived-safe seam (`site_search`/`reporting` precedent). No
 * existing module depends on `comments`, and its lifecycle `dependencies` are ONLY
 * the two Core modules, so the DAG is a clean inward leaf.
 *
 * ## Email is CONSUMED via events/outbox, not a hard dependency (ADR-0032 §4)
 *
 * Reply notifications are published as domain events (`domain_event_runtime`
 * outbox, same-commit, ADR-0006); an email dispatcher (documented follow-up
 * consumer) resolves the ENCRYPTED, minimized recipient at send time, OUTSIDE any
 * DB transaction. Recipient addresses are NEVER carried in an event/response/log.
 *
 * ## Security spine (ADR-0032 threat model)
 *
 * Publication-state is enforced at the resource→thread boundary (a comment is
 * only ever accepted/shown against a PUBLISHED, PUBLIC resource); every query is
 * tenant + resource scoped (RLS FORCE + explicit predicates); comment bodies are
 * stored as raw plain text and HTML-escaped on render (no stored HTML → no stored
 * XSS), with only safe http(s) autolinks (`rel="nofollow ugc noopener
 * noreferrer"`); the public list returns approved-only rows with NO moderation
 * metadata; anti-abuse (honeypot, timing floor, blocked terms, duplicate
 * fingerprint, per-IP rate limits, optional Turnstile OUTSIDE the DB tx) runs
 * server-side; author contact data is minimized (sha256 hash + mask, never raw).

    "Tenant-scoped, MODERATION-FIRST commenting over PUBLISHED, PUBLIC commentable resources (ADR-0032, Official Optional Module). Owns threads, bounded-depth comments (sql/089 — RLS FORCE'd, privacy-minimized author fields: sha256 email hash + mask, hashed ip/ua, never raw), append-only moderation history + abuse reports, per-tenant settings, minimized anti-abuse telemetry, and minimized/encrypted double-opt-in reply-notify subscriptions. It is the CONSUMER/aggregator of reviewed, pure-data `CommentableResourceDescriptor`s that content modules declare via `ModuleDescriptor.commentableResources` (declarative table/column mapping + declarative publication filter — never an executable extractor or tenant SQL); the generic engine reads them through `listModules()`, so base AND derived content types can accept comments without this module knowing any specific one and without a content module depending on `comments`. A comment is only ever accepted or shown against a resource that satisfies its source's declarative publicationFilter, so a draft/private/deleted/scheduled resource never receives or exposes comments. Comment bodies are stored as raw plain text and HTML-escaped on render (no stored HTML → no stored XSS), permitting only safe http(s) autolinks with rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer\". The public list returns approved-only rows and NEVER moderation metadata (reason codes/actor/hashes). Anti-abuse is server-side: honeypot, submit-timing floor, per-comment link/length bounds, configurable blocked terms, duplicate fingerprinting, per-IP rate limits, and optional Turnstile verified OUTSIDE any DB transaction (ADR-0006). The admin moderation API (queue, approve/reject/spam, archive/restore/delete, bulk, settings) is ABAC-guarded, audited with reason codes, idempotency-keyed on high-risk mutations, and observable. Reply notifications go through the domain-event outbox with address-free payloads; the email dispatcher resolves the encrypted recipient at send time. Soft delete + append-only history + a legal-hold-aware retention/anonymization sweep (`bun run comments:retention`) keep content coherent and privacy-minimized. The commenting surface is never an authorization source for the underlying resource.",
