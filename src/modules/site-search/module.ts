/**
 * `site_search` — Official Optional Module admitted by ADR-0031 (Issue #270, epic
 * #261 Wave 2). Admission + first runtime code land together in this PR, bumping
 * the base registry 19 → 20 (`EXPECTED_BASE_MODULE_COUNT` in
 * scripts/scope-consistency-check.ts, regenerated inventories).
 *
 * ## What this module OWNS
 *
 * A tenant-scoped, cross-content PostgreSQL full-text search index (projection)
 * over PUBLISHED website content — `awcms_micro_site_search_documents` (sql/087,
 * RLS FORCE'd, `tsvector`/GIN + `pg_trgm` on title for suggestions) — plus its
 * tenant config (`awcms_micro_site_search_settings`), run ledger
 * (`awcms_micro_site_search_index_runs`), failed-item diagnostics
 * (`awcms_micro_site_search_index_failures`), and opt-in minimized query log
 * (`awcms_micro_site_search_query_log`). It serves the public `/search` page +
 * bounded JSON `/api/v1/site-search/query` and `/suggest` endpoints, and the
 * admin index/settings/diagnostics API.
 *
 * ## Direction of the arrow (ADR-0031 §2) — depends on nothing but Core
 *
 * `site_search` is the CONSUMER/aggregator: content modules PROVIDE reviewed,
 * pure-data `SearchSourceDescriptor`s via `ModuleDescriptor.searchSources`
 * (declarative table/column mapping + publication filter — never an executable
 * extractor), which this module's generic engine reads through `listModules()`.
 * It does NOT declare a `search_source` capability `provides` (that would trip
 * `capability_provider_conflict` with >1 content-module provider) — the
 * descriptor-list riding `listModules()` is the multi-provider, derived-safe seam
 * (`reporting`/`data_lifecycle` precedent). No existing module depends on
 * `site_search`, and its lifecycle `dependencies` are ONLY the two Core modules,
 * so the DAG is intact.
 *
 * ## Security spine (ADR-0031 threat model)
 *
 * Publication-state is enforced at the source→index boundary (the index holds
 * public content only; it is NEVER an authorization source); every query is
 * tenant + locale scoped (RLS FORCE + explicit predicates + tenant-first cache
 * key); the query text is always a bound parameter into `websearch_to_tsquery`
 * (SQL injection impossible); snippets are `ts_headline` sentinels escaped in
 * `renderSafeSnippet` (XSS impossible); anonymous search has per-IP rate limits,
 * query-length bounds, `statement_timeout`, and result caps.
 *
 * ## Deliberately NOT here yet
 *
 * `navigation` is undeclared: the index/settings/diagnostics ADMIN API exists,
 * not an admin screen — the dashboard UI is a documented follow-up (same posture
 * as seo_distribution #266/#268). `capabilities` is undeclared (the search-source
 * seam is the descriptor list, not a capability). `events` stays undeclared:
 * index lifecycle events (`awcms-micro.site-search.*`) are documented log lines in
 * AsyncAPI, not yet published through `domain_event_runtime`. Indexing media
 * metadata and non-`blog_post` resource types is a follow-up (the descriptor seam
 * already supports them).

    "Tenant-scoped, cross-content PostgreSQL full-text search over PUBLISHED website content (ADR-0031, Official Optional Module). Owns the unified search index `awcms_micro_site_search_documents` (sql/087 — RLS FORCE'd, `tsvector`/GIN + `pg_trgm` title index for suggestions), per-tenant config `awcms_micro_site_search_settings`, the index run ledger, failed-item diagnostics, and an opt-in minimized query log. It is the CONSUMER/aggregator of reviewed, pure-data `SearchSourceDescriptor`s that content modules declare via `ModuleDescriptor.searchSources` (declarative table/column mapping + declarative publication filter — never an executable extractor or tenant SQL); the generic engine reads them through `listModules()`, so base AND derived content types are indexed without this module knowing any specific one and without a content module depending on `site_search`. Event-driven incremental reindex (`reindexSearchResource`) plus a deterministic, idempotent reconcile/rebuild (`site-search:reconcile`) keep the index a faithful projection: archive/delete/unpublish removes content from public results with no stale leakage, and reconciliation matches source counts/checksums. The public `/search` page + bounded JSON `/api/v1/site-search/query` and `/suggest` endpoints are tenant + locale scoped (RLS FORCE + explicit predicates + tenant-first cache key), query text is always a bound parameter into `websearch_to_tsquery('simple', $1)` (SQL injection impossible), snippets are `ts_headline` sentinels escaped before any HTML is emitted (XSS impossible), and anonymous search is rate-limited, length-bounded, statement-timeout-bounded, and result-capped. The admin API under `/api/v1/site-search/*` (index status/rebuild/reconcile, settings, diagnostics) is ABAC-guarded, audited, idempotency-keyed, and observable. The search index is a projection of public content only and is NEVER an authorization source.",
