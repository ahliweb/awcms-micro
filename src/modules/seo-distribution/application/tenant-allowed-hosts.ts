/**
 * Resolve the set of hosts a tenant is allowed to redirect TO (Issue #268,
 * ADR-0028 §8) — the `allowedHosts` argument every target validation and every
 * resolve-time re-validation passes to the frozen `classifyRedirectTarget` guard.
 *
 * These are the tenant's VERIFIED, active, non-soft-deleted `normalized_hostname`s
 * from `awcms_micro_tenant_domains` (migration 031) — server-derived, never a
 * request `Host`. Runs inside the caller's tenant transaction (RLS FORCE'd on that
 * table), so it can only ever see THIS tenant's domains. An absolute redirect
 * target is `same_tenant_internal` only if its host is in this set; a target to a
 * host the tenant has since removed fails closed on the next resolve.
