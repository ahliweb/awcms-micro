 * Server-derived canonical host resolution (Issue #266, ADR-0028 §5) — the
 * host-header-poisoning defense at its source. The SEO renderer's canonical /
 * `og:url` / hreflang absolute URLs are built from the tenant's VERIFIED PRIMARY
 * domain (`awcms_micro_tenant_domains.is_primary`, migration 031), never from
 * the request `Host`/`X-Forwarded-Host`.
 *
 * Runs inside the caller's tenant transaction (RLS is FORCE'd on
 * `awcms_micro_tenant_domains` since migration 031), so it can only ever see
 * THIS tenant's domain rows — a second, structural layer under the explicit
 * `tenant_id` filter. Only an `active` (verified), non-soft-deleted primary
 * resolves; anything else returns `null`, and the renderer then degrades to a
 * relative canonical rather than inventing a host (ADR-0028 §5.4, offline-lan
 * safe).
