/**
 * Permission KEY CONSTANTS for the media registry (Issue #633).
 *
 * These are LIVE, not aspirational: `module.ts` declares all 9 in its
 * `permissions` array (built from `MEDIA_PERMISSION_ACTIVITY_CODE` below),
 * `sql/042` seeded them, and `sql/077` moved their ownership from `news_portal`
 * to `media_library` when ADR-0026 step 2 extracted this module. The upload/
 * finalize/cancel routes enforce them via `authorizeInTransaction` (skill
 * `awcms-micro-abac-guard`).
 *
 * This file remains the single source for the key strings: `module.ts`, the
 * route guards, and `tests/modules/media-library-module.test.ts`'s parity
 * assertion all derive from it, so a key can never drift between the descriptor
 * and the code that checks it. Anything needing a media permission MUST reuse
 * these constants rather than re-typing the string.
 *
 * `activityCode` follows this module's own resource shape (`media`, plural
 * dropped to match e.g. `blog_content`'s `posts`/`pages` activity codes),
 * `action` follows the same verb set already used elsewhere in this repo for
 * a soft-deletable resource with an attach/detach lifecycle
 * (`blog_content`'s `posts.create`/`.update`/`.delete`/`.restore`/`.purge`).

/**
 * Managed-media ENFORCEMENT permissions (ADR-0026 step 5a, `sql/079`) — a
 * separate activity code from `media` above, deliberately.
 *
 * `media.*` governs individual media OBJECTS (upload this file, delete that
 * row). `enforcement.*` governs a tenant-wide POLICY: whether content may
 * reference media by raw URL at all. Those are different blast radii, so they
 * must be separately grantable — an editor who uploads images all day has no
 * business flipping the tenant's content-validation policy, and folding this
 * into `media.create` would have granted exactly that to every such editor.
 *
 * There is deliberately **no `disable` action, and there never may be.** See
 * `application/enable-managed-media-enforcement.ts` for the full reasoning: a
 * tenant able to turn its own media validation OFF is precisely the exploit
 * `sql/043`'s header documents as confirmed-exploitable in review. Enforcement
 * is one-way by construction, not by permission configuration — an operator who
 * genuinely must roll it back does so through a deployment-level change, which
 * is an auditable, deliberate act rather than a self-service button.
